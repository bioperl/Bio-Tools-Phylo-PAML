Summary of important user-visible changes for Bio-Tools-Phylo-PAML
------------------------------------------------------------------

{{$NEXT}}

1.7.3     2018-07-01 13:35:29+01:00 Europe/London
  * Bio::Installer::PAML has been removed.  Not only did it no longer
    work, it was also unsecure.  Either install PAML via your system
    package manager, or download it from upstream, currently at
    http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html

  * Check for the presence of paml programs now happens during build
    instead of during the test phase.  This avoids failure reports
    from CPAN Testers.

  * Fixed reading of results for at least codeml and yno00 in cases
    where next_result was previously returning undef.  May be specific
    to PAML version 4.8 and 4.9 (current PAML version).

1.7.2     2017-09-11 19:11:43+01:00 Europe/London
  * First release after split from bioperl-live and bioperl-run.
